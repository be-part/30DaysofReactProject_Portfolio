        <p className="overlay-info">
          This mini app was created as part of Day 11 of the challenge. The
          purpose of this challenge was to practise handling events.
        </p>
        <p className="overlay-info">
          This one was quite difficult. I understood and had handled some other
          events such as onSubmit and onChange previously, but this was the
          first time I had used 'onMouseEnter' and 'onMouseMove'. The first
          thing that I had to learn was how to access things such as the X and Y
          coordinates of the mouse pointer or the window height and width.
        </p>
        <p className="overlay-info">
          Then, I had to experiment with the placement of the
          event-listener/event-handler to make sure it was working in the way I
          wanted it to. For example; yellow box should only move when the mouse
          pointer enters that box, but the coordinates should update no matter
          where the mouse pointer is on the page.
        </p>
      </Overlay>
      <p className="event-text">
        Mouse Coordinates: x = {mouseCoordinates.x}, y={mouseCoordinates.y}
      </p>
      <div onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}>
        <p
          className="moving-box"
          style={{ left: boxCoordinates.left, top: boxCoordinates.top }}
        >
          Can't catch me!
